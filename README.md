# Hello World!

I'll be using this document as a statement of intent.

My intent being to sutdy various tools/programs/languages to get myself to 
a certain level of competency.

From where I'd feel confident enough to apply for a junior DevOps postion at a 
specific organization I'm eyeing. 

As I'm really vibing with what they are about and doing over there.

A basic layout of said study plan as follows:

## Basics

1. Brush up and expand my Linux accumen

## Beginner

1. GIT
2. Shell Scripting

## DevOps greenhorn

1. Ansible
2. Docker
3. Jenkins
4. Kubernetes
5. Terraform

The above would only constitute the first steps of what I believe will be
a long and fruitful journey. I will update my progress as applicable.

Lastly I would like to reference <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/wiki-js/">this</a> guide by Matt Cone, which helped me
kill two birds with one stone and that is the use of proper markdown as 
well as finding a good self hostable wiki app called wiki.js.
